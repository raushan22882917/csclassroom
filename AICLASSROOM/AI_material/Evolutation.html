    <p><strong>The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence: Unveiling Historical Roots for Beginners</strong>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field that has rapidly transformed our world, impacting industries, daily
        life, and the way we perceive technology. To truly appreciate the current state of AI, it's essential to delve
        into its rich history. This journey through time will illuminate the milestones, breakthroughs, and key players
        that have shaped the landscape of artificial intelligence.<br>

        <strong>1. The Birth of AI: A Historical Perspective:</strong><br>
        The roots of AI trace back to the mid-20th century when pioneers like Alan Turing laid the theoretical
        foundation. Turing's work in the 1930s and his famous Turing Test in the 1950s set the stage for the exploration
        of machines mimicking human intelligence.<br>

        <strong>2. The Dartmouth Conference: AI as a Field of Study:</strong><br>
        In 1956, the Dartmouth Conference marked a pivotal moment as the term "artificial intelligence" was coined. This
        gathering of minds, including John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, established AI as a distinct field of study and
        research.<br>

        <strong>3. The AI Winter: Challenges and Setbacks:</strong><br>
        Following initial enthusiasm, the field experienced periods known as "AI Winters," marked by reduced funding and
        interest due to unmet expectations. These challenges, however, paved the way for introspection and
        refinement.<br>

        <strong>4. Rise of Machine Learning: A Turning Point:</strong><br>
        In the 21st century, machine learning emerged as a dominant force within AI. Algorithms that could learn from
        data opened new possibilities, and breakthroughs like deep learning redefined the capabilities of AI
        systems.<br>
