        <h1>Unveiling the Types of Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Overview</h1>

        <div class="article">
            <p>Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, empowers systems to learn from data and improve
                their performance over time without explicit programming. This burgeoning field has seen a plethora of
                techniques, each tailored to specific tasks and data types. In this article, we delve into the various
                types of machine learning, shedding light on their characteristics, applications, and advancements.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data,
                    where each input-output pair is provided during training. The model learns to map inputs to outputs,
                    enabling it to make predictions on unseen data. Popular algorithms include linear regression,
                    decision trees, and support vector machines. Applications range from spam detection to image
                    classification and stock market prediction.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Contrary to supervised learning, unsupervised learning deals
                    with unlabeled data, aiming to unveil inherent patterns or structures within the dataset. Clustering
                    and dimensionality reduction are common techniques used in unsupervised learning. Clustering
                    algorithms like K-means partition data into groups based on similarity, while dimensionality
                    reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) aim to capture essential features from
                    high-dimensional data. Unsupervised learning finds applications in customer segmentation, anomaly
                    detection, and recommendation systems.</li>

                <li><strong>Semi-Supervised Learning:</strong> Sitting between supervised and unsupervised learning,
                    semi-supervised learning utilizes a combination of labeled and unlabeled data for training.
                    Leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data can enhance model performance, particularly when labeled
                    data is scarce or expensive to obtain. Techniques like self-training and co-training are prevalent
                    in semi-supervised learning. Applications include speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and
                    protein structure prediction.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to
                    interact with an environment to achieve a specific goal by maximizing cumulative rewards. Through
                    trial and error, the agent learns optimal strategies or policies. Reinforcement learning has
                    garnered attention for its success in mastering complex tasks such as game playing (e.g., AlphaGo),
                    robotic control, and autonomous driving. Notable algorithms include Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks
                    (DQN), and Policy Gradient methods.</li>
                <li><strong>Transfer Learning:</strong> Transfer learning aims to transfer knowledge from a source task
                    or domain to a target task or domain, accelerating learning in the target setting. By leveraging
                    pre-trained models or features, transfer learning mitigates the need for extensive labeled data in
                    the target domain. This approach has revolutionized various fields, including natural language
                    processing, computer vision, and healthcare. Techniques like fine-tuning and feature extraction are
                    common in transfer learning paradigms.</li>
